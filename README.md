# ColorWow
## Game is a shooting-based game .
Each letter is the first letter of a color name.
Player must hit the letter which is in the same color as the corresponding color name to it.
## For example, (Stroop concept)
        “R” written in “blue” color would end the game.
        While,
        “R” written in “red” color would be the correct hit.
